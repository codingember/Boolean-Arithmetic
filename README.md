Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic is a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental principles that underpin digital computation. In this project, I meticulously applied Boolean algebra to design and implement arithmetic operations using digital logic. I constructed essential components such as half adders and full adders to simulate binary addition and subtraction, highlighting how basic logic gates like AND, OR, and XOR form the backbone of arithmetic circuitry. The project delves into creating truth tables, using Karnaugh maps for logic optimization, and designing circuit diagrams to illustrate how abstract Boolean expressions translate into practical hardware implementations.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on creating modular, well-documented code that clearly demonstrates the step-by-step transformation of Boolean formulas into working circuits. By integrating simulation tools, I was able to test the functionality of each arithmetic module in various scenarios, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of digital systems and Boolean logic but also sharpened my problem-solving and debugging skills. Overall, Project 2 effectively bridges the gap between theory and practice, showcasing how fundamental mathematical principles are applied to solve real-world computational problems.
